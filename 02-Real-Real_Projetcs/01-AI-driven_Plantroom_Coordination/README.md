 # Project 01 - AI-Coordinated Plantroom
 ### [---Source Code Confidential---]


| Complicated Plantroom Coordination....:fearful:|
| :------------------ |

| Any possibility to making use of RL to solve? :thinking::thinking: |
| :------------------ |
| :bulb: May be something like a snake game? But in 3D and mulit-objectives? :snake: |
| May be super difficult .... :dizzy_face: |

| Lets Try :eyes::eyes:|
| :------------------ |
| The First Breakthrough! :scream:|
|![](GIF/01-The_First_Breakthrough.gif)|


| Navigate In Single Plane |
| :------------------ | 
| Finally this stupid AI Get smarter:heart_eyes:...over the weekend :worried:|
|![](GIF/02-Navigate_In_Single_Plane.gif)|


| Navigate In 3D Plane |
| :------------------ | 
| Another Week of Evolve - This snake can finally swim in 3D :sunglasses: |

| Less Bending Working Now! |
| :------------------ | 
| The AI start to learn to run with less bending :open_mouth:|

| Clash Avoidance Work |
| :------------------ | 
| Able to avoud obstaces no. But...Horizontal obstacles are still suck :sweat::sweat::sweat:|
|![](GIF/05-Clash_Avoidance_Work.gif)|


| More Obstacles :astonished:|
| :------------------ | 
|![](GIF/06-More_Obstacles.gif)|


| And More Obstacles :astonished:|
| :------------------ | 
|![](GIF/07-More_Obstacles.gif)|


| Now Next.....How's possible to coordinate for Multi-Agents? :thinking:|
| :------------------ |
|![](GIF/08-Possible_for_multi_agents.gif)|


| Let's see how 2 snakes behave without any training on coordination :snake::snake: |
| :------------------ |
| Quite okay |

| Let's see how 3 snakes behave without any training on coordination :snake::snake::snake: |
| :------------------ |
| Not too bad |
|![](GIF/10-3_snakes_untrained.gif)|

| :scream: Fainlly! The first plantroom done by AI! :sunglasses::sunglasses:|
| :------------------ |
| The power of AI :scream: |

### There is still long way ahead for the successful development. :round_pushpin:
### But it had already made an important small step in 6 months! :walking:
